# Complex projects

We ran a project about this last year.  It worked, but was painful!

* [Full simulation models coded in Python](https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/llm_simpy_models/)
* [Pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13137)
* [Simulation code and prompts](https://pythonhealthdatascience.github.io/llm_simpy/)
