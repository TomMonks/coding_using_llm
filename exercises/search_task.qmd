# My wish list and crazy examples

In this example, I am going to ask Claude 3.7 (with reasoning) to find an academic paper, located an algorithm in it and provide an implementation.  

> Note that in my experience this is hit and miss in terms of if it will work, but its a big improvement on a year ago! I did actually use Claude 3.7 to help me quickly adapt the algorithm into something useful.

The paper is here: [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0037549706065514](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0037549706065514)

```markdown
## search task

locate the paper called "Numerical Methods for Realizing Nonstationary Poisson Processes with Piecewise-Constant Instantaneous-Rate Functions" by Harrod and Kelton published in "simulation" vol 82 issue 3 in 2006

## coding task

Create a python implementation of the direct algorithm for the NSPP.  

## check of reasoning

state your understanding of the direct algorithm and the r_k , c_k parameters.  

## validation task

Provide guidance about how to test that the algorithm you have provided is working as expected
